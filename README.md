# LRU Cache (Low Level Design) 
## Problem Statement
We have to do low level design for a Cache system, which supports following operations:
* **Put**: Allows user to put a key, value to the cache.
* **Get**: Allows user to get the value, based on key.
* And it supports eviction policy as here - https://medium.com/@vienchitang/what-is-an-lru-cache-3e8ad1853584

### Expectations
* Code should be functionally correct, modular and readable. 
* Code should be extensible and scalable, adhering to SOLID principles.
